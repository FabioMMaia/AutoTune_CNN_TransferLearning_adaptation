# AutoTune CNN TransferLearning - adaptation

The repository "AutoTune_CNN_TransferLearning" is a reimplementation of the source code from https://github.com/JekyllAndHyde8999/AutoTune_CNN_TransferLearning/tree/master, with a primary focus on reproducing the original functionality rather than introducing improvements. The purpose of this adaptation is to faithfully recreate the behavior of the original code while addressing any discrepancies arising from changes in package versions, especially within the Keras framework, and variations in nomenclature. The adjustments made aim to ensure an accurate replication of the initial code's performance. Additionally, minor modifications have been incorporated to enhance the user's ability to analyze and comprehend the code for research paper replication purposes. This reimplementation maintains the original code's structure, with the goal of achieving consistent and reproducible results.
